<pre> Chapter 0 - The Surface 
I won't lie to you guys when I say I hated myself. Everyday I spent my time on my computer, ignoring my family, lying, and being a horrible person.
Most of my days were spent hating others or talking with friends over chats that I no longer remember, but this was only a part of my reality.
Everyday I went to school I’d be tired, from no sleep, or be trying to make friends, although I knew it was hopeless. 
Most of my life I never understood social cues I’m 15 as of this first post (JUL 31, 24) and I have 3 or 4 friends total, I’m a kind person, 
I just simply don’t know how to interact with people, but looking back I can see the signs from the start with my love of technology and not wanting to go outside since I was kid, I vividly remember why it started though.
I must’ve been 7 or so, right after my parents got divorced and I was with my dearest friend, Nicco. I knew him most of my life, his mother was almost an Aunt to me as she cared for me as her own. 
My mother and father were always busy with work and traveling, so I had a lot of free time on my hands from the start. Me and Nicco one day had a bad argument, I got tired of him coming over everyday and was mad at him, 
so he left, we didn’t talk for a week, and then my father told me he moved away, to the far north where I’d never see him again. I don’t think I made a real friend again after that.


Chapter 1 - The Descent  

After COVID-19 I was entering my 7th grade year and had no one I knew, every person I did know ignored me as if they didn’t remember anything we used to do. I had a sort of internal dread about making friends from that point on. But we need to get into what happened between COVID well. I must’ve been barely 10 years old when I first saw a stream of this guy playing Minecraft, but it didn’t look right, he was moving fast, and there was things on his screens I never saw before, so I looked it up and it turns out he was cheating, on a server I never heard of. So I logged on for the first time and I meant someone that I can no longer remember the name of, I know that it started with an A though. They took me in for the first time I played and gave me gear and I heard blasts from all over, shortly after I logged out. That was my first experience of something that was soon to ruin my life, fast forward 3 months or so I logged on again, curious to see what was going on. There I met a friend, and we talked, played for a while, and he helped me get more accustomed to my newly found cheats, but that is not important. Soon after this, I would meet the man who raised me, who saved my life, My dearest mentor Luke. At the time a barely 15 year old. We talked on and off as we went through multiple chronicles of this server and he mostly had my back, through day-to-day when we fought future friends and future enemies we had each others backs, until what must’ve been Febrary of 2021, our first musketeer, was accused of something heinous. He denied it to us but we didn’t dare to accept that as the truth, we shortly then after dismissed him from our friend group and started to hate him, and despise him even being near us. We attacked him until he quit, making sure he wouldn’t back for the time being. 

After that chronicle shortly after through Luke (I believe), We met 2 good friends, Their names were Harry and one I do not remember, We’ll call him Larry. Harry was sort of a celebrity on the server we played, being the head of the longest running base, but this is irrelevant. Me, Harry, Luke, and Larry created a group to be known as “TB” in the future, and it quickly grew. I then met a person named Jesus. This would be the first traumatizing experience in a long strand of upcoming ones.

I was a big kid, most likely gaining weight over covid, and Jesus after weeks of talking asked me to Face reveal to him, I must’ve been just 11 years old, and I did it. I also did a “house tour” which they were impressed by if I believe correctly. He asked me to do some silly lighthearted tasks and that was the end of it. Until what must’ve been a day or 2 later where I got news he was leaking everything to everyone and was sending the videos out. I called him where I got bullied and cried. I know this doesn’t sound serious or silly but I was 11 years old, and thought everyone was my friend. This event would give me Body Dysmorphia for the next 4 years. After this event, I slowly learnt everything I knew from Luke, a sort of father figure for me as my father was also so busy with work he couldn’t talk to me. I spent what must’ve been almost 2 years staying up late and talking with him, skipping online classes and failing grades just to play the game with him. I didn’t know at this time, but he found me annoying, yet he stayed and helped me every chance of the way. I predict we must’ve been in call with each other for over 5000 hours at this point, talking for longer. I began to trust nobody and around this time were my first symptoms of mood swings. I have what’s called Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder where unlike BPD or MDD, my mood swings are seconds / minutes unlike BPDs days / weeks. This disorder heavily affected my life, online people were already my only friends and now I was losing them left and right due to one second being angry at them and the next not knowing why. There was times I would lose 4-5 friends at a time and would cry in my bed at night wondering what I did wrong. I just wanted to be liked like the others. This led to out of everyone that once knew the old me, 99.5% now hate me.


I do barely remember everything now as every move I made was out of pure emotion, no logic or sympathy behind anything I did, like leaking everything personal told to me, hating 10 fold for what would be a small act, lying, KOSIng, and more acts I will refrain from saying, as I am not proud of them. 


Chapter 2 -  The Core

Skipping forward to what would now be 8th grade was where I started noticing the after effects of all these days with no sympathy or trust for anyone, the love I once felt for people were gone. My parents, siblings, trusted friends, family, were now gone. I don’t entirely know how to explain this fully, but the word “ love” feel like an empty shell that I am grasping at straws to remember, although now I have accepted it, before I would do anything to please this hunger for something I can no longer remember. Partly due to my loneliness, part due to desperation for love myself I started dating both online and in person, or at least I tried. Most would fall flat as I ended up completely ignoring them or only used them for my own potential gain. It was a sick pleasure I had that I wish I could go back to say sorry to every person I have wronged. Most of this dating fell flat as I said and this is also close to when I believe my anxiety started peaking its head.  Around the middle of 8th grade was where these effects of no sleep and hating myself really started to show up; what once was talking few in far between and friends in some classes, became not talking at all and no friends at all. This is where I started going deeper online. I found the online marketplace community and some other communities through the same streamer that first introduced me to everything back in mid 2020. I was in the first wave of people from this community to move into this new, uncharted territory. Now I regret it much more than anything else. I met some nice people that eventually I lost contact with, but this community absorbed me. I began being paranoid that I was being watched at all times and I had no one to reach out to anyways to solve these issues (read the off chronological order paragraph below this for more detail on this) . So I bared them myself. I do remember a lot of these experiences ruining me, my family was not proud of me. I was fat, ugly, I had no hygiene, I hated myself, and so, so much more. This was my lowest point in my life. I lied so much to the point where I myself didn’t know the truth and what was false. This was around the time my vices appeared like porn, where I would sometime spend nights looking at these videos. Around this time I completely disappeared from the internet and started to work little by little on myself, What was constant dread became only a feeling that I had few in far between. But eventually, after 8 (?) months I came to these same communities (December 23-Feb 24, where I then met 2 very good friends of mine.  

(Off choronological order / Side note) Sometime around the time between these 2 paragraphs (2022-2023) another very core experience for me happened, I was in a call with 2 unnamed people where I was told by T that I had a nice voice, and I said thanks. He said he wanted to talk to me after where he proposed a simple deal for me: I read a script and I get 15% or so of whatever I make from this act. And it turnt out the amount was 380,000$. Obviously, I didn’t get paid. So, at 3 AM on a Sunday I cried the rest of the night thinking I was going to be arrested, unable to sleep. I then became very paranoid about everything and everyone around me. 

Eth and crazy. This was an uplifting hope for me as for the past 3 years up to that point, I had not a single friend to rely on. Only those who would come and go, appear and leave, I no longer talked to Luke as I believe we had an argument and I thought he hated me. They are only a few years older than me. But we spent day after day talking, night into night, sunrise into sunrise, chatting. The 3 of us were a good trio and sort of like the 3 musketeers I once knew as a family years back. Although I talk to them now, I am worried about the future of our friendship. I no longer think it would be in my best interest to keep talking to them, as they are stuck in the past. We mostly spent our days gambling and joking around, meeting and messing with people and sometimes playing games together. These 2 people were a hope for me I didn’t know I could have in possibly the worst part of my life. Obviously I didn’t tell them this. I just joked around and kept a lighthearted, but ready if need be behavior. As I said previously all of this lack of sympathy affected my empathy and love in ways I still do not understand. So it benefited me dearly for helping my friends. This was also present in other friendships I had, I was basically a bulldog for people and I ENJOYED it. I liked doing others harm or ruining others.  But this is besides the point now. It was then around this time where I started to have 2nd thoughts about everything I’ve done. I was almost done with 9th grade, I was gaining weight due to moving to online school around this time, everything was still wrong with me and I was not getting better spending 20 hours of my day on my computer. And maybe it was maturity, maybe it was some sort of envy. But I started to talk to eth about everything I was thinking, maybe leaving would be better. And he agreed, although I do not remember fully I think I brought up the idea of quitting after 9th grade finished, as I wanted to get into a good college and online was hurting my grades. But little did I know it would only be in only a couple days, instead of 3 more months. There’s a lot of untold tales from this time, but none that are important. All you need to know is I made a lot of enemies, I was a horrible person, I was mentally ill, and I saw so much messed up stuff that I do not want to write.

Around April I lied completely to everyone I knew and said I got arrested for something, though I do not remember what. I then for that month experienced possibly the greatest month of my life, and realized I would do anything for this life of peace and calm of what was once wrath and discord. After April I came back only for few days, and then I quit. With leaving with only 2 people I knew, my bestfriend Axel, and another man named Kelan, both I became friends with around December-January time. I departed the island I once knew and started to work on myself, this starts the Ascent of my journey. May.

Chapter 3 -  The Ascension 

I quit what must’ve been late April, though much did not change, little things did that I worked myself on. I started attempting to eat less junk food, which went extremely well, and with that I started seeing the weight drop. And I also believe I made an effort to quit my addictions, which has also helped a lot. I do not remember my exact goals but they were along those lines and, eventually I started having a wiser mindset towards the world. I worked on my moodswings for so long, day by day of self reflection and working myself to these goals. All but my anger moodswings were completely docile, and I could practically control them. Shortly after, I must’ve cut one of the biggest anxiety triggers, but also a comfort blanket for me. I cut my hair after growing it out for 2 years. I lied to myself so much I convinced myself I liked it, but it also triggered and dociled my anxiety, a YinYang. I then stopped listening to rap / drill / trap and started unplugging myself from social media. First was TikTok, then Twitter, then Instagram, As I didn’t enjoy being connected as much, I simply wanted to learn and enjoy my peaceful life for what it was. But there was still a massive weight on my shoulders that I couldn’t bare anymore. What must’ve been somewhere in late may I was playing Mario Kart I believe with my brother to the right of me, and my mom to the left of me, and I brought up my computer and they asked what I would do, and I told them everything basically start to finish. Only with slight changes between parts of the story unlike with this one. I remember my mom was crying, my brother was angry, and all I could do was look at my mother and be ashamed of my actions, unable to cry for myself. Shortly after this my mother and I started to argue a lot, but during this time I was only doing more self reflection and learning more about how I wanted to live and then man I wanted to be. This was around the time where my texting habits completely changed and I stopped swearing. I lost 20 lbs and started eating healthier than before, and I picked up guitar around early June and have been enjoying it.  5 Weeks ago (June 28- July 21)  me and my mom got a breaking point. I moved in with my dad for 3 weeks to do what I’ve done 4 times before, reflect. I spent weeks with roaches crawling around the house, dead bugs everywhere, Spiders in my bed, The smell of dogpee all around the house, and the dirtiest place I’ve ever been despite it being a massive home. I came back with a lot more calm mindset, and I can say for the first time in 3 years I can say my moodswings are completely gone. I’m a good person. I’m happy.


Chapter 4 - The Present

I am still healthy, learning guitar, and now I am reading more, I am now barely on my phone. You can read more about this on the second blog as advertise-y it sounds. I no longer lie and truly believe I am reformed and have given my life to god for a better life I carved myself. This is a 3000 word manifesto that I put 2 and a half hours into, please try and take something out of this. Please try and learn something everyday. Do 1 good thing a day. Learn from the people that have built you up and learn for those who can not see the light. To Luke, Thank you for raising me. I wouldn’t be anyone without you. To axel: I’m always here if you need to talk, you’re my best friend and I cherish everything you say dearly. And everyone else Thank you for everything you taught me. I am a new person, not “smash” or “kk” or anything else. I am me, Joshua.

It’s one habit at a time you must destroy and you must learn peace in solitude if you take a route like mine, there was ups and lows but I am now happy. Thank you for reading, <pre>
